Problem 1.20 Page 35

Copier maintenance. The Tri-City Office Equipment Corporation sells an imported copier on a franchise basis and performs preventive maintenance and repair service on this copier. The data below have been collected from 45 recent calls on users to perform routine preventive maintenance service; for each call, X is the number of copiers serviced and Y is the total number of minutes spent by the service person. Assume that first-order regression model (1.1) is appropriate.

a. Obtain the estimated regression function.

b. Plot the estimated regression function and the data. How well does the estimated regression
function fit the data?

c. Interpret bo in your estimated regression function. Does bo provide any relevant information here? Explain.

d. Obtiun a poim estimate of the mean service time when X = 5 copiers are serviced.

Problem 1.24 Page 26

a Obtain the residuals e and the sum of the squared residuals sum(residuals)^2. What is the relation between the sum of the squared residuals here and the quantity Q in (1.8)?

b. Obtain point estimates of variance and sd. In what units is sd expressed?

Problem 2.5 Page 90

a. Estimate the change in the mean service time when the number of copiers serviced increases by one. Use a 90 percent confidence interval. Interpret your confidence interval.

b. Conduct a t test to determine whether or not there is a linear association between X and Y here; control the a risk at .10. State the alternatives, decision rule, and conclusion. What is the P-value of your test?

c. Are your results in parts (a) and (b) consistent? Explain.

d. The manufacturer has suggested that the mean required time should not increase by more than 14 minutes for each additional copier that is serviced on a service call. Conduct a test to decide whether this standard is being satisfied by Tri-City. Control the risk of a Type I error at .05. State the alternatives, decision rule, and conclusion. What is the P-value of the test?

e. Does bo give any relevant information here about the "start-up" time on calls-Le., about the time required before service work is begun on the copiers at a customer location?

Problem 2.24 Page 93

a. Set up the basic ANOVA table in the format ofTable 2.2. Which elements ofyour table are additive? Also set up the ANOVA table in the format ofTable 2.3. How do the two tables differ?

b. Conduct an F test to determine whether or not there is a linear association between time spent and number of copiers serviced; use a = .10. State the alternatives, decision rule, and conclusion.

c. By how much, relatively, is the total variation in number of minutes spent on a call- reduced when the number of copiers serviced is introduced into the analysis? Is this a relatively small or large reduction? What is the name of this measure?

d. Calculate r and attach the appropriate sign.

e. Which measure, r or R2, has the more clear-cut operational interpretation?

Problem 4.3 Page 172

Refer to Copier maintenance Problem 1.20.

a. Will bo and b l tend to err in the same direction or in opposite directions here? Explain.

b. Obtain Bonferroni joint confidence intervals for f30 and f3I, using a 95 percent family confi- dence coefficient.

c. A consultant has suggested that f30 should be 0 and f3I should equal 14.0. Do your joint confidence intervals in part (b) support this view?
