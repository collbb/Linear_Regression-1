Copier maintenance. The Tri-City Office Equipment Corporation sells an imported copier on a franchise basis and performs preventive maintenance and repair service on this copier. The data below have been collected from 45 recent calls on users to perform routine preventive maintenance service; for each call, X is the number of copiers serviced and Y is the total number of minutes spent by the service person. Assume that first-order regression model (1.1) is appropriate.

a. Obtain the estimated regression function.
b. Plot the estimated regression function and the data. How well does the estimated regression
function fit the data?
c. Interpret bo in your estimated regression function. Does bo provide any relevant information here? Explain.
d. Obtiun a poim estimate of the mean service time when X = 5 copiers are serviced.



Question:

4.3. Refer to Copier maintenance Problem 1.20.

a. Will bo and b l tend to err in the same direction or in opposite directions here? Explain.

b. Obtain Bonferroni joint confidence intervals for f30 and f3I, using a 95 percent family confi- dence coefficient.

c. A consultant has suggested that f30 should be 0 and f3I should equal 14.0. Do your joint confidence intervals in part (b) support this view?
